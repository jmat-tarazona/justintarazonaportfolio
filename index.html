      <h1 class="section-title">About Me</h1>
      <section class="entry-box" id="about">
        <p>
          Hello!, from the top, you guessed it that's me, I'm Justin Tarazona. My major is computer science 
          at Queens College. This is my website where you'll get to know me a little better. On the side, you'll see my business portfolio, where you might be curious about my skills, and languages, and see my resume for roles that I'm capable of fulfilling. Or maybe you wanna get in touch not just about work but opportunities. Overall you can dive in and get to know me as a person and my background. 
        </p>

      <h1 class="section-title">Interests</h1>
      <section class="entry-box">
        <p>
          The thing that led me to pursue computer science was my vast curiosity and interest in the tech field given its multifaceted nature. Especially with its roles and positions; I'm someone who loves to try different things. That gravitated me toward computer science with its broad nature, allowing me to delve into different fields.  Overall, I'm someone who enjoys building things while understanding how they function. It leads me to build and work on projects like this website, where I can display my work.
        </p>

      <h1 class="section-title">Hobbies</h1>
      <section class="entry-box">
        <p>
          When I'm not focusing on leveling up my mind, I take fitness rather seriously. I find it enjoyable. As a form of being active and relaxing. Despite their contrast emotion that one would typically encounter while working out. However, I find the reward to be worthwhile and mainly refering to the satisfaction of completion.  
          Other pastimes, that grab my attention are reading both physical and audio cause the voice acting that goes into it truly rivals that of actual media. Books that captivate me on top of movies and shows are those that offer compelling stories of vastly different representations of the possible absurdity of daily life. 
        </p>
      </section>

      <h1 class="section-title">Aspirations</h1>
      <section class="entry-box">
        <p>
          A goal or desire that I'm always striving for is building up my education in order to develop my skills and understanding. That goes for not just in school but also in the workforce. It's why I seek out positions or events that help facilitate real applicable learning on top of the fundaments. All with the goal in mind of utilizing those skills to offer solutions to real-world problems. In many ways for me, coding is coming across a problem and coming up with a solution, in my own unique way.
